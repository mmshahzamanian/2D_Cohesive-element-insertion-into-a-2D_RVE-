Here, a brief instruction is given about how to use the code atep by step.

1) Threshold the real image of the microstructure using the imagej tool.
2) Create the 2D-RVE using the OOF2 interface, OOF2 can be run online.
3) Extract the element sets for the matrix and precipitates ans store them in two separate MATLAN data in a format of *.mat. Examples of the MATLAB data are attached.
4) Insert the length of the RVE in x and y directions.
5) Insert the number of elements in x and y directions.
6) Run the MATLAB code.
